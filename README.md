# Jibbap Journey

## Introduction
Jibbap Journey is a social media web app that allows food lovers and creators to quickly share their homemade recipes. No blogs and distracting ads, just good food. The name jibbap, translated from Korean, means "home cooked meals". In Korean culture, it is fairly typical to get very vague and imprecise recipes from our mothers and relatives. Ingredients are "eyeballed" and seasoned to personal taste. Therefore, a recipe takes on its own journey but also becomes your very own. Sign up and share your recipes!
